# Workout App - MERN

### 🚀 Motivation
I took on this project primarily to dive into the MERN stack and get a hands-on understanding of how it all works. I wanted to learn by doing something I can relate to – in this case, building a workout app. It's a personal challenge that keeps me engaged and helps me grasp these technologies in a practical way.

### 🧰 Why I Built This Project
The main reason behind building this app was to learn and grow my skills with the MERN stack. I figured creating something genuinely useful would make the learning process more enjoyable and meaningful.

### 🧩 Problem I'm Solving
The challenge I wanted to tackle is making the MERN stack less intimidating. Learning new technologies can be overwhelming, so I wanted to break it down by creating a focused application. This project is about simplifying the learning curve and making the MERN stack more accessible, not just for me, but for others who might feel the same way.

### 📚 What I Learned
Building this app has been a fantastic learning experience. I delved into MongoDB for the database, used Express.js for the backend, developed the frontend with React.js, and made it all work together with Node.js.

### 💫 Unique Aspects
The uniqueness of this project lies in its dual purpose – not only is it a practical workout tracker, but it's also a personal learning journey with the MERN stack. It's more than just a simple app; it's a stepping stone to mastering these technologies in a way that's relevant and relatable.

### 🛠️ Features
Easy workout log creation with exercises, sets, reps, and date
Chronological display of logged workouts
Responsive design for seamless user experience on various devices

### 📝 Project Description
This app is my way of learning the MERN stack while creating something I genuinely find useful – a workout tracker. It's not just about logging workouts; it's about making the learning process enjoyable and relatable. I aimed for simplicity but not at the cost of functionality, and the project will continue evolving as I explore more features and improvements based on my learning journey.

### 🏃🏾 Running this project
1. Have an mongodb database set-up. Congfigure an backend.env file with a PORT # and the Mongodb URI.
2. Start the backend server: run 'npm start' in the backend directory
3. Start the frontend server: run 'npm start' in the frontend directory
